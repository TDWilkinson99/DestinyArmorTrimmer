# DestinyArmorTrimmer
A python script that analyzes a destinyArmor.csv file from Destiny Item Manager and suggests armor for you to delete. This project has no affiliation with Bungie, or Destiny Item Manager.

I wrote this for my clan, if you stumble across this you're welcome to also use it.

For a guide on how this works, please watch [this long tutorial video I made](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLPRLdU5hvY)
